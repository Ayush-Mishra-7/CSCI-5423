## Data Sources

### Fish
- **Zenodo Dataset**: Raw videos of empirical observations studying large shoals of sulphur mollies (P. sulphuraria). Data includes cluster metrics such as area, volume, time duration, and speed.
  - [Zenodo Record](https://zenodo.org/records/7323527)
  
- **GitHub Repository**: Code for deep learning-based analysis using LSTM models to detect perturbations in cellular automata models simulating fish shoals.
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RobertTLange/automata-perturbation-lstm)

- **Figshare Supplementary Files**: Supplementary data for the study on defensive shimmering responses in *Apis dorsata*, triggered by dark stimuli moving against a bright background.

### Shared Dataset and Starter Code
These two resources are linked to the same study:
- **Starter Code**: Includes tools for analyzing the dataset.
  - [Zenodo Record](https://zenodo.org/records/4983257)
- **Database**: Contains the raw data for analysis.
  - [Dryad Database](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.sn02v6x5x)
